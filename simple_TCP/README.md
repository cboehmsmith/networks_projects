# TCP Server/Client
### Cat Smith for CS5700/Summer 2020
#
A simple TCP server and client. Currently the server address is hard-coded to the local host address (127.0.0.1) and 
port 12000.

To run the program, first run TCPServer.py. Then run TCPClient.py in a separate terminal window. TCPClient will require 
you to input a sentence to send to the server. No other input is required since the server address and port have been 
hard-coded.
