If you're getting a little tired of reading science fiction novels that are just like the ones you read last
month or last year, this book is for you. It's published under the label "An Ace Science Fiction Special"
because it's just that, something fresh and different and, we believe, a novel superior to most of those
you'll find today.

I'll tell you why I think so a little later; first, though, I should say a little about the Ace Science Fictions
Specials series.

The SF Specials program is specifically designed to present new novels of high quality and imagination,
books that are as exciting as any tale of adventures in the stars and as convincing as the most careful
extrapolation of the day after tomorrow's science. Add to that a rigorous insistence on literary quality
— lucid and evocative writing, fully rounded characterization, and strong underlying themes (but not
Messages] — and you have a good description of the stories you'll see in this series.

The publishers of Ace Books believe that there are many readers today who are looking for such books,
at a time when so many science fiction novels are simply skilled (or not so skilled) rehashings of plots
and ideas that have been popular in the past. Science fiction by its very nature ought to tell stories that
are new and unusual, but too many of the science fiction books published have been short on real
imagination - They are, in fact, timid and literarily defensive. The Ace SF Specials are neither.

The SF Specials began more than fifteen years ago, when the science fiction field was in a period of
creative doldrums similar to the present: science fiction novels then were mostly of the traditional sort,
often hackneyed and familiar stories that relied on fast action and obvious ideas. Ace began the first
series of SF Specials with the idea that science fiction readers would welcome something more htan
that, novels that would expand the boundaries of imagination, and that notion provedto be correct: the
books published in that original series sold well, collected numerous awards, and many of them are
now considered classics in the field.

Beginning in 1968 and continuing into 1971, the Ace SF Specials included such novels as Past Master by
R.A. Lafferty, Rite of Passage by Alexei Panshin, Synthajoy by D. G. Compton, The Left Hand of Darkness
by Ursula K. Le Guin, Picnic on Paradise and And Chaos Died by Joanna Russ, Pavanne by Keith Roberts,
Isle of the Dead by Roger Zelazny, The Warlord of the Air by Michael Moorcock, The year of the Quiet
Sun by Wilson Tucker, Mechasm by John Sladek, The Two-Timers by Bob Shaw, and The Phoenix and the
Mirror by Avram Davidson . . . among many others that could be mentioned, but the list is already long.

Most of the books were nominated for awards. Rite of Passage won the Nebula Award; The Left Hand of
Darkness won both the Nebula and the Hugo; The Year of the Quiet Sun won the John W. Campbell
award. Other books in the series won more specialized awares. Most of the novels have remained in
print over the years since they were first published.

That original series ended when I left Ace Books and moved to California in 1971, but its successes
hadn't gone unnoticed. Both writers and publishers saw that a more "adult" sort of seventies more
adventuresome sf novels were published than ever before.
